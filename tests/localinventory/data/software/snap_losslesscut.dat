  LosslessCut aims to be the ultimate cross platform ffmpeg GUI for extremely
  fast and lossless operations on video, audio, subtitle and other related
  media files. The main feature is lossless trimming and cutting of video and
  audio files, which is great for saving space by rough-cutting your large
  video files taken from a video camera, GoPro, drone, etc. It lets you
  quickly extract the good parts from your videos and discard many gigabytes
  of data without doing a slow re-encode and thereby losing quality. Or you
  can add a music or subtitle track to your video without needing to encode.
  Everything is extremely fast because it does an almost direct data copy,
  fueled by the awesome ffmpeg which does all the grunt work.
